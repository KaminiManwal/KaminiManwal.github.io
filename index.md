[INSTACART: Online grocery analysis] (https://github.com/KaminiManwal/INSTACART-PYTHON) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px"> Conducted an exploratory data analysis and derive insights for improved customer segmentation, I analyzed over 800,000+ customer records. The analysis involved segmenting customer behaviors based on demographic information to optimize marketing campaigns. I performed data wrangling, merged datasets, derived new variables, and designed charts to uncover key insights. One notable finding was that the top three departments accounted for 51% of sales, while the bottom 5 departments contributed only 1% of sales. Based on these findings, it is recommended to allocate advertising efforts accordingly. Additionally, scheduling ads on the least busy days, such as Tuesday and Wednesday, can be beneficial.
