[INSTACART: Marketing strategy for an online grocery store](https://github.com/KaminiManwal/INSTACART-PYTHON) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px"> Conducted an exploratory data analysis and derive insights for improved customer segmentation, I analyzed over 800,000+ customer records. The analysis involved segmenting customer behaviors based on demographic information to optimize marketing campaigns. I performed data wrangling, merged datasets, derived new variables, and designed charts to uncover key insights. One notable finding was that the top three departments accounted for 51% of sales, while the bottom 5 departments contributed only 1% of sales. Based on these findings, it is recommended to allocate advertising efforts accordingly. Additionally, scheduling ads on the least busy days, such as Tuesday and Wednesday, can be beneficial.

[Rockbuster Stealth](https://github.com/KaminiManwal/ROCKBUSTER-SQL) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px"> The goal of the project was to assist the Business Intelligence (BI) department to improve sales. My first task was to load Rockbuster's data (approx. 3 MB, that includes 15 tables) into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, I utilized SQL queries to analyze the data and address business questions. To visualize the findings, I employed Tableau, resulting in insights such as the revelation that the revenue gain from the top 10 nations with the highest number of customer accounts accounted for 52% of the total revenue gain. Additionally, I identified the top 10 movies that contributed the 3% to the revenue gain. Based on these insights, the recommendation is to prioritize countries with the majority of customers and focus on the top revenue-generating movies.
