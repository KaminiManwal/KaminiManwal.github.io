[INSTACART: Marketing strategy for an online grocery store](/pdf/Instacart.pdf) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px"> Conducted an exploratory data analysis and derive insights for improved customer segmentation, I analyzed over 800,000+ customer records. The analysis involved segmenting customer behaviours based on demographic information to optimize marketing campaigns. I performed data wrangling, merged datasets, derived new variables, and designed charts to uncover key insights. One notable finding was that the top three departments accounted for 51% of sales, while the bottom 5 departments contributed only 1% of sales. Based on these findings, it is recommended to allocate advertising efforts accordingly. Additionally, scheduling ads on the least busy days, such as Tuesday and Wednesday, can be beneficial.

[ROCKBUSTER STEALTH: Answering business questions for an online video rental company](/pdf/Rockbuster.pdf) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px"> The goal of the project was to assist the Business Intelligence (BI) department to improve sales. My first task was to load Rockbuster's data (approx. 3 MB, that includes 15 tables) into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, I utilized SQL queries to analyze the data and address business questions. To visualize the findings, I employed Tableau, resulting in insights such as the revelation that the revenue gain from the top 10 nations with the highest number of customer accounts accounted for 52% of the total revenue gain. Additionally, I identified the top 10 movies that contributed the 3% to the revenue gain. Based on these insights, the recommendation is to prioritize countries with the majority of customers and focus on the top revenue-generating movies.

[INFLUENZA: Preparing for flu season in US](/pdf/Influenza.pdf) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px"> The goal of the analysis was to assist a medical staff agency in providing temporary workers during the Influenza season in the US. To achieve this, I analyzed demographic data from 2009 to 2017 across 50 states. The analysis involved tasks such as data wrangling, transforming data, integrating two datasets, and deriving new variables. Utilizing Tableau for visualization, I presented insights on the top states affected by Influenza in the 65+ age group, as well as the peak season (December to April) of influenza. These findings helped the medical staff agency in effectively allocating temporary workers based on the identified trends.

[GAMECO: Marketing budget planning](/pdf/GameCo.pdf) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px"> The objective of the analysis was to support managers with making informed decision about marketing budget distribution for the next year. In order to drive actionable insights, I analyzed transactional data from the past 20 years, taking into account different dimensions like time, region, product platform and genre. I performed EDA (exploratory data analysis) trying to visualize how distributions of different dimensions changed over time. That led me to conclusion that initial assumptions of the project were faulty and the best way how to split marketing budget was to follow the top 5 genres and platforms trend from the past 3 years.
